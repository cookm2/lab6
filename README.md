### Lab 6: Structure from Motion and Potree Visualization

> Process

I used Agisoft Photoscan to create a model from pictures provided by our course TA, Jared 

Ritchey. To create the SFM model in Potree I used the LAS file provided by Jared and created

a medium resolution rendering. 

> Images from Photoscan

I have included screen grabs from my mac running Photoscan for the first portion of this lab

in the img folder included in this repository.
